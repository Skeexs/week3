# Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
First and foremost, we need to install [ox\_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/tag/v3.29.0).\
When you've installed that, you'll have to start it before the store script. \
If you don't do that, It won't work because it depends on some ox\_lib functions
{% endhint %}
