# Preset Categories

In the shared/config.lua, we have a table called Config.Categories. This is what I call preset categories, it's simply for quick configuration of new stores that's going to use the same categories.\


Looks like this when you have downloaded it for the first time.

```lua
Config.Categories = {
    ["247"] = {
        {
            label = "General",
            id = "general",
            products = {
                { label = 'Vehicle Repair Kit', itemId = 'repairkit', price = 4, },
                { label = 'Rubber',             itemId = 'rubber',    price = 4, },
                { label = 'Copper',             itemId = 'copper',    price = 4, }
            }
        },
        {
            label = "Food",
            id = "food",
            products = {
                {
                    itemId = 'sandwich',
                    price = 14,
                    label = "Bread",
                    description = "10 Slices of bread",
                }
            }
        }
    },

    ["weaponshop"] = {
        {
            label = "Pistols",
            id = "weapons",
            products = {
                {
                    itemId = 'weapon_pistol',
                    label = 'Glock',
                    description =
                    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

                    price = 2500,
                    image =
                    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Glock_17_MOD_45154998_%28Transparent%29.png'
                }
            }
        },
        {
            label = "Rifles",
            id = "rifles",
            products = {
                {
                    itemId = "weapon_carbinerifle",
                    label = "Carbine Rifle",
                    description = "En karbin rifle",
                    price = 20,
                    image = "https://r2.fivemanage.com/LRlfVgIK7NNsxmVbS4FS5/images/carbine-rifle.png"
                }
            }
        },

        {
            label = "Ammo",
            id = "ammo",
            products = {
                {
                    itemId = "ammo_pistol",
                    label = "Pistol Ammo",
                    description = "10 bullets",
                    price = 20,
                    image = "https://r2.fivemanage.com/LRlfVgIK7NNsxmVbS4FS5/images/ammo-pistol.png"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Nothing crazy, right?\
Now where going to go over what these do and how it functions etc.\


## Category interface

When creating a new category, it's not just passing in whatever you want.\
You'll need to follow my interface to get it to work.\


```lua
--- Category interface
{
    label = "Category Name", --The name in the ui that everybody will see 
    id = "category_name", -- This one i recommend naming it something unique
    products = {} -- this one i will show in the next example
}
```

It's nothing more than that, but the products need to be there, else it will be hard to buy the items from the shop, right? ðŸ˜…\


## Product interface

Now where here, the products for the category\


```lua
--- Product interface
products = {
    {
        itemId = "the_spawn_name_of_item", -- The spawn name of the item, like "bread", or such
        label = "label_in_the_ui", -- Label of item in the shop
        description = "not_shown", -- Leave this
        price = 10, -- How much money that will be removed on purchase of item
        image = "", -- If you don't want the inventory image of the item
    }
}
```

Now you're good to go, now you can configure your own preset category for the next shop!\
But, wait?! You're maybe asking how to use this category?\
I'll teach you\


## How do i use it?

As we saw in the beginning, we saw a Config.Categories table, where there were `["247"]`\
This will be the name we'll use for indexing/calling for the categories.\
So when creating new category, you do like this

```lua
["your_category_name"] = {
    --- insert the categories in here
}

--- and when using it in Config.Shops

Config.Shops = {
    { categories = "your_category_name" }
}
```

Thanks for coming to my ted talk, now you're a proffesional at this.&#x20;
